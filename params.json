{"name":"wr","body":"# wr (Weighted Random)\r\nwr is a weighted random implementation in Python.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n`wr.get` can be fed both mappings (such as dictionaries) and sequences of pairs containing what to return and a integer representing their respective weight. It returns a the key of in case of mappings based on the weights defined in the key's corresponding value. The key can be anything hashable but the weight must be a integer.\r\n\r\nOptionally you may feed `wr.get` with a sequence of pairs.\r\n\r\n## Structures\r\n```python\r\n{'cat': 60, 'dog': 30, 'bird': 10}\r\n# Or as a sequence:\r\n[(('cat'), (60)), (('dog'), (30)), (('bird'), (10))]\r\n```\r\n## Example\r\n```python\r\n>>> import wr\r\n>>> data = {'cat': 60, 'dog': 30, 'bird': 10}\r\n>>> animal = wr.get(data)\r\n>>> print animal\r\ncat\r\n# Well, the cat had a good 60% shot at it.\r\n```\r\n## Installation\r\nInstall wr with `pip install wr` or just [download wr.py] (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/wr) and place it in your project directory.\r\n## License\r\n[GNU Lesser General Public License] (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html)","tagline":"Python Module Implementing Weighted Random","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
